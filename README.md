# D-MTS: Decentralized Marketplace for Telecommunication Services

This repository contains a complete demonstration of a decentralized marketplace for telecommunications, integrating smart contracts, self-sovereign identities (DIDs), ERC-20 tokens (Telecoin), and a modern web interface. The system allows identity registration, publication and hiring of assets and services, and B2B payment orchestration.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

- **OS:** Linux/macOS or WSL (Windows)
- **Node.js:** version ‚â• 16 (via NVM recommended)
- **npm**
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose**
- **MetaMask**
- **Operational Besu Blockchain Network**
  - You may use your own local network **or** follow this tutorial:  
    üîó [besu-production-docker](https://github.com/jeffsonsousa/besu-production-docker)
- **Deployed Smart Contracts** in the network:
  - Use:  
    üîó [contracts-indy-besu](https://github.com/jeffsonsousa/contracts-indy-besu)  
    üîó [contracts-telecom-marketplace](https://bitbucket.cpqd.com.br/projects/AERF/repos/contracts-telecom-marketplace/browse)

Once contracts are deployed, extract each contract address and insert it into your environment variables.

## Network Setup

### Frontend

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jeffsonsousa/dapp-telecom-marketplace.git
cd dapp-telecom-marketplace
cd dapp/
```

1. Create a `.env.local` file in the root of `dapp/` and add:

```env
VITE_TELECOIN_ADDRESS=0x...
VITE_ASSETS_ADDRESS=0x...
VITE_SERVICES_ADDRESS=0x...
VITE_HIRE_ASSET_ADDRESS=0x...
VITE_HIRE_SERVICE_ADDRESS=0x...
VITE_MARKETPLACE_WALLET_ADDRESS=0x...
VITE_MARKETPLACE_PRIVATE_KEY=0x...
VITE_ETHEREUM_PROVIDER_URL=http://localhost:8545
VITE_INDY_DID_REGISTRY=0x...
VITE_SCHEMA_REGISTRY=0x...
VITE_CREDENTIAL_DEFINITION_REGISTRY=0x...
VITE_REVOCATION_REGISTRY=0x...
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start frontend:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Frontend will run at: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

---

### Backend

```bash
cd server/
```

1. Create a `.env` file with:

```env
MARKETPLACE_PRIVATE_KEY=0x...
TELECOIN_ADDRESS=0x...
ETH_RPC_URL=http://localhost:8545
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start backend:

```bash
node server.js
```

Backend will run at port `3001`, with routes like:

- `GET /api/assets`
- `GET /api/services`
- `POST /api/register-service`

---
